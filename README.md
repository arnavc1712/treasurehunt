# treasurehunt
Built a Search Engine from ground up, including **web crawlers**. It uses **Breadth First Search** to crawl the websites, with the depth of the BFS being configurable.

Added features and a very simple User Interface for keyword lookup, with results being served according to the **PageRank** Algorithm.

Have create **Indexes** on the keywords too. For now it supports single keyword lookup only.
